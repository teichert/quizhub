        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>Last updated: 2024-03-04</p>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is
            handled in quizhub for Web.
        </p>

        <h2>Personal Information</h2>
        <p>
            We do not collect, store, use, or share any personal information
            about you when you visit our website.
        </p>

        <h2>Google Drive Access</h2>
        <p>
            The application allows you to login with your Google account to view
            and edit files in your Google Drive. We do not have access to your
            Google Drive. Authentication is handled directly by Google, and only
            you can access your files through the app.
        </p>

        <h2>No Tracking</h2>
        <p>
            We do not track you. The app is hosted on GitHub Pages/Vercel and is
            purely a frontend application without any backend processing. No
            login or tracking mechanisms are implemented on our side.
        </p>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>
            Our app uses Google Drive API for accessing Google Drive files. We
            do not control the privacy practices of Google. Please refer to
            Google's privacy policy for more information.
        </p>

        <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>
            We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time, although it is
            highly unlikely. Thus, you are advised to review this page
            periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by
            posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
        </p>
